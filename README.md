# Skin-Cancer-Detection-using-CNN-Deep-Learning-

This project demonstrates a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model that detects **malignant (cancerous)** and **benign (non-cancerous)** skin lesions using deep learning.  
It is a **demo version** that works even without an external dataset by generating synthetic data, helping visualize model training and accuracy trends.

---

## Features
- Builds and trains a CNN model using TensorFlow & Keras.
- Classifies images into **cancerous vs. non-cancerous** categories.
- Displays **real-time training accuracy and validation accuracy** using Matplotlib.
- Beginner-friendly project to understand **medical image classification**.
- Can be extended to use real datasets like **ISIC 2020** for research purposes.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.11+**
- **TensorFlow / Keras** – CNN model building  
- **NumPy, Matplotlib** – data simulation & visualization  
- **scikit-learn** – preprocessing and data splitting
